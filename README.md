# ARK: Survival Ascendend Global Blacklist

This project is a simple but yet useful database tool for players of the infamous video game ARK: Surival Ascendend (ASA). It's made to help tribes to be aware of potential new players that may have bad intentions to them. With this database and the provided API, tribes can lookup the Discord users before the invite and see if there were any reports from any other tribe about that user.

The Global Blacklist is currently hosted here: [globalblacklist.damianryse.de](https://globalblacklist.damianryse.de)

### About the developer
I'm not really a web developer. I have no clue about CSS, Javascript and PHP. Most of the code was written by ChatGPT and then edited/adjusted by me. It's also probably full of security issues, namely XSS or SQLi.
